<p>
The ramshackle building stands oh so high<br>

Lighted by the moon in the sky.<br>

I walk in through the wooden door.<br>

As quiet as a crab on a sandy shore.<br>

Shadows begin to lurk in the walls.<br>

Shadows make me seem timid and small.<br>

I use my flashlight to look around.<br>

The house that seems devoid of sound.<br>

But then it comes out of the air.<br>

Making my jump and giving a scare.<br>

A ghostly figure with glowing eyes.<br>

Glowing like stars in the night sky.<br>

I ran like the wind and through the house.<br>

Scampering away like a tiny mouse.<br>
